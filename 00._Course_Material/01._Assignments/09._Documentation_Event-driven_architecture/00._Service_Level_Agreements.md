# 00 [DLS Group] SLAs (Service Level Agreements)

**Type**: DLS Group

For your DLS project write a SLA and publish it. 

SI Motivation: Written SLAs provide a nice service for people considering integrating with your service. 


### SLAs vs. SLOs vs. SLIs

Learn about the difference between SLAa/SLOs/SLIs. Here are some optional resources:

### Service Level Agreement

With your DLS group agree on and write a SLA for your system. It must be published. 

**Advice**: As highlighted in the links above, don't overpromise; especially not for new systems. Professional SLAs incorporate a compensation mechanism that offers payouts. These payouts escalate in accordance with the duration of downtime surpassing the agreed-upon thresholds.

The SLA should contain:
 
* **Service Scope**: Defined services, features, and processes.

* **Performance Metrics**: Key performance benchmarks (uptime, response time).

* **Response and Resolution**: Expected times for incident handling.

* **Security Measures**: Defined protections.

* **Compliance Standards**: Required regulations.

* ~~Compensation Scheme: Penalties for not meeting metrics.~~

Compensation scheme is crossed out for obvious reasons, but kept to show that professional SLAs usually include it.

### Bonus

Additional, create a SLO and/or SLI.

### Hand-in

Though the SLA must be published and publically available, there is no hand-in in Teams.
