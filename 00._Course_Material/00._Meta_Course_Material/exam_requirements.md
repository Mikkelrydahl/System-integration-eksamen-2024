# System Integration - Exam

This document contains the formal requirements for the exam. Additional information can be found [here](./about_the_exam.md).

The total exam time is 30 min.

**Language**: Danish (Unless you have applied for exemption which has been approved)

You will draw multiple questions from the following two columns in the semester plan: 

* Learning Goals.

* Resources and activities.

The questions are a mix of theory and showing code examples. 

If you only draw theoretical or code questions we will draw more questions until you have drawn at least one of each type.

You are not allowed to bring notes to the exam.

You are expected to have the code examples ready in one project, sorted by assignment codes and prepared to immediately show the relevant files when you draw a question. The only exceptions are the assignments that are marked [Optional] that lack an assignment code.

In most cases you will not be asked to run the code examples. Instead, you should be able to open the relevant files and point to the relevant part of the code. Don't just read the code out loud. Explain what it does and how it relates to the topic.

The code examples are part of the mandatories. If you donâ€™t have them ready, you will be asked to live code the topic without online help or use of code-assisting tools (Github Copilot). To avoid this, be prepared.
